# Running scripts
In the `scripts` directory, there are `.sh` scripts for convenience. Be sure to kill any running processes because there is no clean-up in the start scripts.

# Handy kill process commands
- linux command for node: `killall node`

- windows command for node: `Taskkill /F /IM node.exe`
